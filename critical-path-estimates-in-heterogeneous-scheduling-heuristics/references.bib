	abstract="This paper considers the Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) algorithm for scheduling the tasks of an application, represented by a directed acyclic graph, onto a bounded number of heterogeneous machines. We focus on the appropriate selection of the weight for the nodes and edges of the graph, and experiment with a number of different schemes for computing these weights. Our findings indicate that the length of the schedule produced may be affected significantly by the scheme used, and suggest that the mean value based approach used by HEFT may not be a particularly good choice.",
