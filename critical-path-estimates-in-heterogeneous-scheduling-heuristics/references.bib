	abstract="This paper considers the Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) algorithm for scheduling the tasks of an application, represented by a directed acyclic graph, onto a bounded number of heterogeneous machines. We focus on the appropriate selection of the weight for the nodes and edges of the graph, and experiment with a number of different schemes for computing these weights. Our findings indicate that the length of the schedule produced may be affected significantly by the scheme used, and suggest that the mean value based approach used by HEFT may not be a particularly good choice.",

	abstract = {Abstract A ‘standard task graph set’ is proposed for fair evaluation of multiprocessor scheduling algorithms. Developers of multiprocessor scheduling algorithms usually evaluate them using randomly generated task graphs. This makes it difficult to compare the performance of algorithms developed in different research groups. To make it possible to evaluate algorithms under the same conditions so that their performances can be compared fairly, this paper proposes a standard task graph set covering many of the proposed task graph generation methods. This paper also evaluates as examples two heuristic algorithms (CP and CP/MISF), a practical sequential optimization algorithm (DF/IHS), and a practical parallel optimization algorithm (PDF/IHS) using the proposed standard task graph set.

	abstract = { This paper is concerned with establishing the mathematical basis of the Critical-Path Method—a new tool for planning, scheduling, and coordinating complex engineering-type projects. The essential ingredient of the technique is a mathematical model that incorporates sequence information, durations, and costs for each component of the project. It is a special parametric linear program that, via the primal-dual algorithm, may be solved efficiently by network flow methods. Analysis of the solutions of the model enables operating personnel to answer questions concerning labor needs, budget requirements, procurement and design limitations, the effects of delays, and communication difficulties. }
