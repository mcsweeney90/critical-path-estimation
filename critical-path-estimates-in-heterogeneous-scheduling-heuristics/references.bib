	abstract="This paper considers the Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) algorithm for scheduling the tasks of an application, represented by a directed acyclic graph, onto a bounded number of heterogeneous machines. We focus on the appropriate selection of the weight for the nodes and edges of the graph, and experiment with a number of different schemes for computing these weights. Our findings indicate that the length of the schedule produced may be affected significantly by the scheme used, and suggest that the mean value based approach used by HEFT may not be a particularly good choice.",

Task durations are independent random variables with discrete, finite ranges. The following results are obtained: (1) computing a value of the cumulative distribution function of project duration is \#P-complete, (2) computing the mean of the distribution is at least as hard, and (3) neither of the problems in (1) and (2) can be computed in time polynomial in the number of points in the range of the project duration unless P = NP.},,
