# Critical path estimation in heterogeneous scheduling heuristics

This repository supports work I am currently doing concerning how critical path estimates are computed and used in heterogeneous scheduling heuristics such as Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT). At the moment the hope is that this will eventually become a paper, although it may only end up as a chapter in my thesis. This is a work in progress so will be frequently altered!
